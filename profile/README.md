# ArthemizLabs

Production-grade SaaS engineering organization focused on distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and secure backend architecture.

---

## Mission

ArthemizLabs builds and maintains production-grade SaaS systems designed for reliability, scalability, and security. The organization's engineering efforts are concentrated across five core disciplines:

- **Backend Architecture** — Design and implementation of service-oriented and microservice systems with clear separation of concerns.
- **Cloud Infrastructure** — Provisioning and management of cloud resources following infrastructure-as-code principles.
- **Secure Systems** — Security embedded at the architecture level, not as an afterthought.
- **Data Engineering** — Structured data pipelines, storage strategies, and query optimization for operational workloads.
- **DevOps Practices** — Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and environment parity across the full software lifecycle.

## Ecosystem Overview

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **OpsLedger** | B2B monitoring SaaS platform providing operational visibility, alerting, and audit trail capabilities for multi-tenant environments. |
| **Arthemiz** | DNS and reverse proxy infrastructure layer handling traffic routing, TLS termination, and service discovery across deployments. |
| **Vendas3D** | E-commerce engine built for catalog management, order processing, and transactional workflows at scale. |
| **Sentinel Agent** | Low-level system telemetry agent written in C, responsible for collecting host-level metrics with minimal resource overhead. |
| **SystemHealth** | Container monitoring extension providing real-time health checks, resource utilization tracking, and alerting integration for containerized workloads. |

## Engineering Principles

- **Clean Architecture** — Enforce strict boundaries between domain logic, application services, and infrastructure adapters.
- **Secure by Design** — Apply threat modeling and least-privilege access at the system design phase.
- **Infrastructure as Code** — All environments are reproducible and version-controlled; no manual provisioning.
- **Observability-First** — Instrumentation, structured logging, and distributed tracing are built in from the start.
- **API-Driven Systems** — All inter-service and external communication is contract-defined and versioned.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | Java / Spring Boot, Python / FastAPI, Node.js / NestJS |
| **Frontend** | React / TypeScript |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL, Oracle |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Nginx, AWS, Terraform |
